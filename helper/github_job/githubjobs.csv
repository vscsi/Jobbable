<p><strong>Who we are</strong>
SIG is an ambitious global technology and consultancy firm delivering independent software quality assurance solutions. We believe we can make the world a better place by helping developers and organisations create better software. To accomplish this, our Software Development Team is continuously improving and expanding Sigrid, our Software Assurance Platform. This is no small task: we are adding new analysis capabilities; we are growing and developing our frontends to become more intuitive, integrated and feature-rich; we are preparing our backend to scale and handle more code, faster.</p>
<p><strong>How we work</strong>
As you might expect, we hold quality in high regard: we measure the quality of our code our process and our operations, more than you might be used to. We code, write tests, review, discuss and refactor if needed. We don’t just spit out features and move on to the next thing. We automate things wherever we can and throw out stuff we no longer need. In the long run, quality equals speed. Some data you may be interested in: we have a Java backend, Angular/Typescript frontend. Our pipeline starts in Gitlab which produces docker containers handled by Nexus deployed on a Puppet-managed cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Where you come in</strong>
We are looking to grow our team at a steady pace. What we do is pretty high end, so we can’t and won’t hire people in bulk. You’ll quickly find yourself responsible for significant chunks of our landscape. Our consultants are heavy users of our software. They are close by, and you’ll be working with them to get things right. You'll be doing some proper engineering, ranging from finding and solving performance bottlenecks to exploring new tools and technologies. And, once you're on to something, you'll talk about it in one of our frequent knowledge sessions.</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong>
You'll work on the software that runs our business, so what you do makes a difference. You'll work in a modern environment with modern technologies, and you'll work with great colleagues in a diverse team. Through our process and coding standards, you will become an even better coder than you are today. There's plenty of opportunities to educate yourself through online training, attending conferences and trying out new stuff during our annual hackathon. On a lighter note, we have weekly Friday get-togethers to provide some desirable distraction. In general, you have a lot of control over your schedule as long as you get the job done.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MSc in technical field.</li>
<li>Several years of experience as a software developer in Java, Angular or comparable technologies.</li>
<li>Experience with managing cloud computing resources is a plus.</li>
<li>Experience with IT operations is a plus.</li>
<li>Excellent communication skills.</li>
<li>Strong affinity with software intensive systems.</li>
<li>Excellent command of the English language, Dutch is a plus.</li>
<li>Strong analytical skills and able to draw relevant conclusions.</li>

This is the next generation spreadsheet - with (i) more power than Excel, (ii) better collaboration than Google Sheets, (iii) great experience on both web, desktop, and mobile, (iv) as well as several additional powers that users will be excited about. This will be a very engineering-heavy and design-heavy product. Not just another CRUD app.</p>
<p>The Frontend Engineer/Web Developer role will help lead the frontend team. You have to care about beautiful and fast frontend products as this is the cornerstone for this project. Example of an interesting frontend challenge: implementing a snappy grid-based rendering of information that can scale to fluidly displaying and manipulating thousands of data points - text labels, numbers, charts e.t.c.</p>
<p>Tech Stack</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript (JavaScript)</li>
<li>Interaction with computation-heavy code written in Rust through WebAssembly (Frontend engineers themselves don't need to know Rust, but are of course welcome to learn/contribute to that part of the code base if they want)</li>
<li>Interaction with backend via WebSockets</li>
<li>React for all of the UI except for the grid rendering - up to the frontend team to decide whether to use it or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience</p>
<ul>
<li>5+ years experience working on projects with a complex frontend. Even better if the frontend involved allowing users to manipulate rich content on the web page (e.g. edit documents, draw/manipulate images/animations)</li>
<li>Strong knowledge of JavaScript (and/or TypeScript)</li>
<li>Desire for and experience of crafting beautiful frontend experiences</li>
<li>Experience with WebAssembly is not necessary and is not required, but can act as one of many indicators that the person has worked on some interesting frontend challenges.</li>
</ul>

We're looking for someone who is truly interested in the practice of modern computing, from coding to Kubernetes.
In addition to technical competence, the teammate we seek is someone who is firmly aligned with our master values. All core engineers at Aiva must be comfortable as not only students, but also as teachers; and, above all, skillful communicators.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:
-Engaging closely with Aiva leaders to understand product direction</p>

<p>-Mastering the features offered by the Aiva platform itself</p>

<p>-Coordinating with other teams within Aiva in order to create the best solutions possible</p>
<p>-Staying up-to-date on the latest innovations within the voice assistant ecosystem, and sharing that knowledge with the team</p>
<p>-Evaluating new tech, and determining whether it might benefit our end-user experiences and development efficiency</p>
<p>Core Skills &amp; Experience:
-Experience with the command line, code versioning tools (git), and other technical essentials</p>
<p>-Experience with these technologies or similar ones: UNIXy OSes, Google Cloud, AWS, Go, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, PostgreSQL, Redis, JavaScript/TypeScript, gRPC, and GraphQL.</p>
<p>-Ability to collaborate and coordinate with different teams in order to develop solutions</p>
<p>Ability to understand business requirements and turn them into working technical solutions</p>
<p>About Us
Aiva is the voice operating system for better care.  We use Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and other voice assistants to empower patients and seniors throughout their care journey.  They enjoy more entertainment options, better control of their environment and closer communication with their care team.  For example, when you tell Aiva what you want, she understands and routes your request to the most appropriate caregiver, who uses our proprietary mobile app to triage and respond to requests in their own voice.</p>
<p>Aiva is based in Los Angeles.  Hospital clients include Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and post-acute clients include Amica Senior Lifestyles.  Aiva investors include the Google Assistant Investments Program, the Alexa Fund, Act One Ventures, Mucker Capital and the Cedars-Sinai Accelerator.

<p>Code crunching space traveler</p>
<p><strong>How do you make our customers happy?</strong></p>
<p>With 10 million customers, 30 million monthly visits and about 16 million products on display, bol.com is the most successful online retail platform in The Netherlands and Belgium. And when we say ‘platform’, we mean it. Well over 23,500 external partners – and counting – enrich the product base. Data-driven, adventurous (making mistakes is no biggie, as long as learnings are shared), we intend to deliver on our promise to make life easier and more fun for customers. And that is exactly what our 500 IT professionals (25% internationals), who comprise 90+ autonomous Scrum teams, do.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest challenge</strong></p>
<p>Although our business model may sound familiar, our approach to network retailing sets us apart from the usual suspects. So much so, in fact, that while we admire the achievements of international platforms, we don’t necessarily consider them our peers. We opt for a more localized approach (up close and personal!) and our ways of working reflect our idiosyncratic DNA. At bol.com, it’s all about autonomy and taking ownership, so end-to-end responsibility is the norm. Can you shoulder that?</p>
<p><strong>Your responsibilities as a Software Engineer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Develop clean, high-performance code that facilitates and inspires over 10 million customers, 23k partners, and almost 2.000 colleagues</li>
<li>Think of ways to make solutions scalable and future-proof</li>
<li>Help your team grow and team up with business stakeholders to ensure that solutions add customer value</li>
<li>Take full, end-to-end ownership over team solutions</li>
<li>Experiment with cutting-edge tooling – including tooling you add to the stack</li>
</ul>
<p>As Software Engineer, you will join one of our Scrum teams. We believe in ownership, and you will have a mandate (together with your team) to develop features end-to-end. At bol.com, we are big on autonomy, and that makes us strong: we expect you to make all (technical) choices along the way but also to assume ownership when things go awry. You build it – you run it – you love it is our mantra, and we live it every day. Every Scrum team is part of a Fleet – every Fleet part of a Space.</p>
<p>As for your GPS location within the bol.com universe, check out which one you may call your (temporary, because moving between spaces is possible) home.</p>
<p><a href=""https://careers.bol.com/tech/spaces/"">Check out our spaces</a></p>
<p><strong>No matter the space you’ll join, your tech stack includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Java (8 or higher)</li>
<li>Kotlin</li>
<li>GO</li>
<li>Google Cloud stack</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 reasons why this is(n’t) for you</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, because you take pride in writing high quality code, and are versed in Java and (some of)</li>
<li>Yes, because you’re a true pioneer, both when it comes to coding and tooling</li>
<li>Yes, because you want to team up with a market leader that feels like a scaleup</li>
<li>Not, because business concerns don’t concern you #letthemeatcode</li>
<li>Not, because you don’t believe the land of ‘weed, windmills and wooden shoes’ has much to offer to techies</li>
<li>Not, because you want to be taken by the hand; autonomy &amp; ownership are not your thing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where you’ll work</strong></p>
<p>As Software Engineer, you’ll join a Scrum team you can always rely on for feedback and continuous professional growth. The setting? Think ‘campus’, including a game room and soccer field. Despite our size, we make fun of rigid rules and traditional work structures. We may be a market leader, but you won’t get a whiff of the corporate odor you associate with that. Our strength derives from working together as equals and constantly improving each other. After all, you can accomplish great things on your own, but so much more with your colleagues! Given that over 25% of our IT fleet consists of internationals – if you want the receipe for a celebratory Brazilian feijoada or want to sample authentic Greek mezze, Utrecht is the place to be – we have a lot of relocation experience.

<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p><strong>Daily treats</strong></p>
<p>With good food, you get happy bol.commers. That's why we make sure there are a lot of lunch possibilities, if you want a quick bite, a snack or a healthy salad.</p>
<p><strong>Money and more...</strong></p>
<p>Working at bol.com is challenging and therefore you get something in return. Besides salary, you will receive a yearly bonus, holiday allowance, holiday entitlement of 29 days, travel allowance, group insurance and more.</p>

6c42e825-7bd6-4957-bb0b-6cf02b12520d,false,Open source community builder,Devhouse Spindle,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Thu Nov 05 10:02:02 UTC 2020,https://jobs.github.com/positions/6c42e825-7bd6-4957-bb0b-6cf02b12520d,Full Time,"<p><em>Ready to put your passion for open source and your talent for connecting people to the test? Come help us build our open source community centered around VoIP technology!</em></p>
<p>We are looking for a colleague well-versed in networking, community building, and project management to come join our team and help us build our newest endeavor, an open source community. At Devhouse Spindle, we recognize the value and importance of open source software. Whether it’s using existing projects in our VoIP platform VoIPGRID, or open sourcing parts of our Vialer Webphone, we incorporate open source software whenever we can. These efforts led us to notice that the VoIP open source scene is very fragmented. There are various projects and companies working to further open source VoIP technology, but nothing bringing them together. With that in mind, we set out to build the Open VoIP Alliance, a community of projects and companies working together to progress the development of VoIP technology.</p>
<p>As our new colleague, you would work to build the structure of the community, as well as build the momentum for it. One of your first duties will be to see what we have already built and come up with creative ways to further our ideas. You would also be our spokesperson and networker, so having experience with that as well as knowledge of the best ways to get others involved is a must. You will also take part in planning and organizing hackathons, meetups, workshops and the like to keep our community active. As an individual, you are organized and enthusiastic. You don’t mind being the person that gets things running and pulls the rest of the team along, but you do value communicating and collaborating with the team and the community. For this role, English is the main communication language, so you must be comfortable communicating in English regularly. Other languages are welcome, but not required.</p>
<h2>Your professional profile</h2>
<p><em>You:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a great command of English, our working language</li>
<li>Have experience with community building</li>
<li>Have experience working in open source communities</li>
<li>Have experience with project management</li>
<li>Have your own opinions on running a community</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bonus points if you:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Have experience with VoIP technology</li>
</ul>
<h2>About Spindle</h2>
<p>Devhouse Spindle is a growing and ever-changing organization on a mission to connect the world using open and free communication. With almost 60 colleagues, we develop the tools that make this possible such as VoIPGRID, our award winning telefony platform. Alongside that we develop an app (both Android and iOS versions), Webphone, and a browser plugin which allow you to use the VoIP platform wherever you are.</p>
<p>Next to the tools we develop, we also connect people through the foundation, 48percent.org and the open source community, the Open VoIP Alliance. Spindle is located in Groningen, a beautiful city known for its innovation and the second fastest growing tech city in the Netherlands.</p>
<h2>Working at Spindle</h2>
<p>If you look around the office, you’ll notice we do things a bit different around here:</p>
<ul>
<li>We organize ourselves using a system called Holacracy. We believe every colleague is able to contribute to the organization rather than relying on a traditional hierarchy. Having no managers comes with extra responsibility to take ownership of your work and set priorities that help to further the organization.</li>
<li>We work with a “build, measure, learn” mentality and open mindset. We recognize that not everything you do is going to work right away. We praise experimentation and reward trying something new, even if the lesson is to not try it again.</li>
<li>We have an open and transparent salary system. Every colleague is placed in the pathway and a level best fitting their education, experience, and visible behavior. We encourage growth and have clear guidelines and expectations for doing so.</li>
<li>We are a diverse and inclusive team of international coworkers. We value the differences that each person brings to the table and think that it's those differences that strengthen our organization.</li>
<li>We strongly believe in open source. We show this by open sourcing our code when possible, using other open source projects for our VoIP platform, contributing to projects, and we have even started the Open VoIP Alliance to encourage collaboration when it comes to VoIP open source software.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we offer</h2>
<ul>
<li>A relaxed and welcoming culture with celebrations, events, and trips</li>
<li>A competitive salary and good pension benefits</li>
<li>An annual study budget and study days for personal and professional growth</li>
<li>Two weeks leave when welcoming a new member to the family</li>
<li>Other benefits that contribute to your health, well-being, and work/life balance</li>
</ul>

<p>Taptap Send is VC-backed (including by Reid Hoffman), rapidly growing and a great place for those looking for both impact and a fast-paced tech startup environment. Read more about the journey in Reid Hoffman’s words.</p>
<p>Our product is an app-based solution that lets immigrants send money back home to emerging markets instantly and at very low prices. Since launching in summer 2018, we’ve already moved tens of millions of dollars and reached tens of thousands of customers. We’re live in seven European countries, and we support payments into Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Bangladesh; with lots more countries launching soon.</p>
<p>Global remittances account for over $500 billion annually, most of which moves back into developing countries. But the market is dominated by traditional services that are expensive, can take days to arrive, and have limited reach in rural areas. We're helping people to send that money instantly and securely at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>In addition to Reid Hoffman, we are backed by Canaan, Flourish Ventures, Helios and others. Our team is based across London, New York, Paris and Brussels and we pride ourselves on hiring exceptional talent -- our team members come from a wide variety of top-tier tech companies, professional services firms, and industry leaders, including Twitter, Yahoo, Amazon, Google, McKinsey, Bain &amp; Co, KPMG, Cravath, and Vodafone.</p>
<p>To continue our rapid growth, we're looking to bring on people who are passionate about our mission and excited to work in a small start-up environment.  We have competitive salary and stock options and great benefits, and we were recently rated one of the best companies to escape to by Escape the City's ""Escape 100"".</p>

<p>We are looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but growing engineering team to define, build and iterate on features for our consumer-facing product! You will work closely with Product, Operations, Customer Support and other functions to build a reliable, intuitive, and simple experience for our users. As an early member of the team, we hope you will also have a lot of impact on our team culture, processes and norms.</p>
<p>Taptap Send is a cross-platform mobile app developed with React Native and Flow, which talks to a backend service written in Kotlin and backed by a PostgreSQL database, all of which runs on AWS and is managed via Terraform and Ansible. This is a frontend-focused role, but you will have plenty of opportunities to work on all parts of our tech stack.</p>
<p>We’re excited to grow the team in order to tackle our upcoming challenges, which include scaling up to handle increased volume, improving UI and UX to drive growth and retention, handling increasingly sophisticated fraud attacks, building internal tools for our customer support and acquisition efforts, and much more.</p>
<p>You are</p>
<ul>
<li>Excited to join a small, growing team, working across all parts of the stack and collaborating on product decisions</li>
<li>Great at balancing speed of execution with writing clean, well-designed code</li>

<li>Passionate about using your engineering skills to make the world a better place</li>
<li>Excited to be a part of an inclusive culture where everyone brings their whole selves to work</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements</p>

</ul>
<p>Nice to have but not required</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with Flow or TypeScript</li>
<li>Experience working on a multi-platform mobile app with a significant volume of traffic</li>
<li>Experience creating design mocks or other kinds of UX work</li>
<li>Experience working on systems that have real-world performance and reliability constraints</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>Competitive salary (based on experience)</li>
<li>Medical, vision, and dental insurance</li>
<li>Unlimited leave</li>
<li>Flexible hours</li>
<li>Regular team events</li>
<li>Weekly team lunch and free drinks in the office</li>
<li>Professional development opportunities (e.g. language lessons, trainings, etc.)</li>

<p><strong>Simple</strong> is a free, open source app developed by Resolve to Save Lives, and is used by nurses, doctors and population health experts to improve treatment for patients with high blood pressure. Simple is currently operational in multiple states of India as well as in Bangladesh, and is being used to manage more than 300,000 patients across more than 1000 clinics, with plans for deployment in additional program focus countries over the next year. Our goal is to save 100 million lives (<a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32443-1/fulltext"">The Lancet</a>).</p>
<p>Learn more about the Simple project at <a href=""http://simple.org"">Simple.org</a> and in <a href=""https://www.simple.org/blog/what-we-are-learning/"">this article on our blog</a>.</p>
<h2>Job summary</h2>
<p>Simple is software that saves lives. Built using Ruby on Rails, Simple provides a web dashboard to healthcare workers and public health experts, enabling them to see where and how people are getting healthier. This dashboard is critical to helping improve blood pressure control rates across large populations, but also provides detailed information to help improve individual clinics.</p>
<p>Our Rails backend also provides a sync API to Simple’s Android app, allowing our offline-first design to work in clinics with limited network access. While this offers a unique set of challenges, it’s what makes our app fast and reliable for nurses every day.</p>
<p>We’re hiring a full-time Rails developer to help us add features to the Rails application and improve the APIs powering Simple. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivering fast, simple software used by nurses in clinics every day</li>
<li>Working on solutions for hundreds of millions of patients</li>
<li>Building holistic products with empathy, not just writing code</li>
<li>Contributing to an open source project used in multiple countries</li>
<li>Collaborating closely with a talented, international team of Android and Rails developers as well as designers</li>
<li>Supporting an offline-first app, including the challenges of navigating a distributed system</li>
<li>Managing deployments in cloud and on-premise environments</li>
<li>Ensuring patient privacy and data security</li>
</ul>
<p>You will help extend our API to allow for new features and apps, secure our application to meet security best practices, and ensure that our Rails app is reliable, scalable, and easy to modify. Our code has grown quickly, and you will help make sure that we keep complexity down, clean up technical debt as needed, and write code that doesn’t require extensive commenting and explanation.</p>
<p>User experience is critical to our success, so you will be working with our design team to make sure that we’re iterating quickly, as getting health data into official hands will help save lives. Our app needs to be easy to understand, for users and developers. Your work will have a real, tangible impact on peoples’ lives.</p>
<h2>Key responsibilities</h2>
<p>Here are some example projects that give you some idea of what’s in store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crafting dashboard charts and data that provide public health experts with a clear story of how patients and clinics are doing</li>
<li>Adding two-factor auth support for our web app users</li>
<li>Collaborating with our Android team to profile API endpoints and improve their performance</li>
<li>Adding an A/B testing framework for making the most effective reminders for patients to continue care</li>
<li>Ensuring admin tools for adding users and facilities are functional and easy to use</li>
<li>Improving how our app is deployed in AWS, on-premise servers in government data centers, and in other third-party cloud services</li>
</ul>
<h2>Length of contract</h2>
<p>12 months with potential for extension.</p>
<h2>About you</h2>
<p>We are seeking an experienced candidate who is ready to do work that matters. The ideal candidate embraces learning about our challenges, has solved Rails app-related challenges (especially at scale), and can work effectively with our entirely remote team.</p>
<p>We’re keen to find someone for whom these problems look pretty familiar. We don’t want a specialist, but instead someone who is just as comfortable slinging ERB views as they are digging into writing query classes and debugging Rails routing errors. Critically, we also want someone who is curious, writes and communicates well, anticipates user needs from a human level, and always looks to keep things simple and iterate. We’re looking for someone who can self-manage, plans their time wisely, and delivers straightforward solutions to vague problems.</p>
<h2>Mindset</h2>
<p>We try hard to be a team full of empathy, inclusion, and respect. We trust each other, have hard conversations with open mindedness, and assume positive intent. We document as much as possible, work as asynchronously as possible, and meet via video conference when necessary. Proposing ideas and trying new things are paramount; always being right is not. We are frequently wrong and try to write code that we don’t mind deleting when we learn new things. We’re excited for you to participate and look forward to helping you grow your own skills as well.</p>
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p>Given that we’re writing software for the globe, it’s critical that our team represent the diverse environments in which we operate. We strive for an inclusive, diverse team with different perspectives, ideas, and identities.</p>
<h2>Required qualifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Experience:</strong> Very fluent with Rails development and supporting user-facing and API components. Experience with devops and production deployment is a plus.</li>
<li>
<strong>Education:</strong> As for your specifics, a CS degree is not required, nor do we require a certain number of years of experience. What really matters is how you got here, why you want to be here, and what you can do.</li>
<li>
<strong>Availability:</strong> You’re free to work when you want, provided that you can overlap and collaborate with the team as needed. That said, we understand that staying up all night does not lead to great work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Balance:</strong> We work hard, but we also make sure you feel supported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This is a remote position. Our team spans the US east coast (EST) and India (IST) time zones, and overlapping with our teams makes things much easier. To expand our team’s time coverage, we’re looking for someone between EST and UTC+1 time zones (US East Coast, Europe, West Africa, etc.)</p>
<p>You also must have reliable, consistent access to a network for frequent online collaboration.</p>
<h2>How to apply?</h2>
<p>Please take the time to describe yourself and why you’ll be a great fit for this project. We encourage people of under-represented backgrounds to apply even if you took an unconventional path to become a developer.</p>

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>
<p>CrowdStrike leverages a scanning engine software development kit (SDK) and its components for both internal and external customers in the form of multiple low-level C libraries and some Python wrapper packages for the C libraries. Some of these libraries are used in the Falcon sensor, which is a lightweight module that observers system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll work directly with the C libraries (and Python packages) and build test suites for them, including end-to-end validation, smoke tests, regression tests, integration tests, system tests and performance tests.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Software Development Engineer in Test</strong> (SDET) position in the Machine Learning Software Engineering Team. As an SDET, you will be focused on orchestrating, maintaining and driving the test automation process across many low level C libraries and some Python wrapper packages. As an SDET, you will be a key contributor in the team’s focus on quality and performance of the SDK.</p>
<p>SDETs use their strong software development skills to build effective tools, harnesses, and specialized tests to ensure that quality and performance. SDETs also participate actively in design and code reviews, and collaborate with the team to ensure end-to-end system functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Career Progression</strong></p>
<p>This position has the potential to transition to a software engineering role using Rust.

<li>Help ensure that our products are polished and deliver a good customer experience before and after they get into customers’ hands</li>
<li>Debug bugs found through test or customer cases to identify root cause and use the input to improve tests</li>

<p>We'll aim to review your application within a day or two and if we think you'll be a good fit we'll schedule an initial phone call. If we think CrowdStrike might be the place for you after that we'll invite you for an on-site interview where we'll review some code, discuss architecture in modern web apps, work processes and professional development. This will be followed by a second technical interview by video call, after which you'll get an answer within 3-4 days.</p>

<p>Can develop high-quality code in C/C++ and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience on Linux or Unix developing product code with the following characteristics:</p>
<pre><code>            - high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading

            - high reliability requirements

            - detailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>About the Product Group:</strong></p>
<p>This role is for the IT SecOps product group. Organizations are scaling their data environments at an increasing rate. These evolving, heterogeneous environments can be difficult to manage, as IT and security teams struggle to see who and what is running on their networks. In order to effectively implement a security solution, organizations must  first declutter their data environments. IT hygiene (Falcon Discover) provides this needed visibility. While Falcon Spotlight, helps in analysing and detecting vulnerabilities across these hosts.</p>
<p><strong>About the Role:</strong></p>
<p>CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”which is a lightweight agent installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud.</p>
<p>The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, can correlate malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>Software Development Engineer</strong> (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Windows/Linux/Mac OS X. SDE’s in the team own design and development of features for the products in IT SecOps product group. Features may cross-cut core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows, Mac and Linux. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design and develop user mode software for deployment on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X systems</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can develop high-quality code in C/C++/Swift and can demonstrate that capability, be it through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience on developing product code with the following characteristics:</p>
<pre><code>         - high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading

         - high reliability requirements
</code></pre>

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>About the Role:</strong></p>
<p>Crowdstrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>The Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches.""  In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments.  This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.</p>
<p>As a sensor engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for Windows based attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping develop cross platform features that cut across core OS subsystems such as analysis of file system, memory, process, and network telemetry. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices.  You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.</p>
<p><strong>You will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend our existing codebase and test suites utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies &amp; tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.</p>

Door een toenemend aantal projecten willen wij ons IT-team begin 2021 uitbreiden met een Senior Software Developer OutSystems. Binnen de bewegelijke energiemarkt is het onze ambitie om de beste functionaliteiten en applicaties voor onze gebruikers te ontwikkelen. MAIN Energie is een platte organisatie met veel ruimte voor jou en het team om zelf te bepalen hoe er gewerkt wordt. Je bepaalt dus zelf samen met collega’s hoe je tot het gewenste resultaat komt. Als Senior Developer geniet je van veel vrijheid en je schakelt makkelijk tussen de hoofdlijnen en details. Jij voelt feilloos aan wanneer je moet acteren en het team daarbij moet en kan helpen.</strong></p>
<p>Ons IT-team werkt met Agile Scrum en is opgedeeld in twee development teams. Het ene team is verantwoordelijk voor de sales- en klant gerelateerde applicaties. Het andere voor de intern gebruikte applicaties. Er werken zeven ontwikkelaars, een delivery manager, een functioneel specialist, twee product owners en een scrummaster op de afdeling IT. Momenteel werken we aan het nieuwe MAIN Flex product, het Energieklikportaal en de Sectorrelease. Zorg jij er voor dat we dit begin 2021 succesvol kunnen opleveren en uitrollen? Lees snel verder en we zien je reactie graag tegemoet!</p>
<h2>Wat ga je doen bij MAIN Energie?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Samen met de product owners, functioneel specialist, delivery manager en collega-ontwikkelaars nieuwe applicaties en functionaliteiten ontwikkelen;</li>
<li>Jouw kennis en vaardigheden inzetten om vraagstukken en ontwikkelingen in kaart te brengen en oplossingen aan te dragen voor nieuwe en bestaande functionaliteiten;</li>
<li>De door jou opgedane kennis, ervaring en vaardigheden inzetten om het team te helpen groeien. Jij brengt de frisse en nieuwe blik mee waar wij naar op zoek zijn.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Het leukste aan het werken als Software Developer bij MAIN Energie, is dat je jezelf kunt blijven uitdagen. De user story’s die worden geschreven zijn vaak uniek en dit zorgt er voor dat elk nieuw project weer een nieuwe uitdaging met zich mee brengt” aldus Randy &amp; Robin, Software Developers bij MAIN Energie.</em></p>
<h2>Waarom dit jouw droombaan is</h2>
<p>Omdat jij service en kwaliteit belangrijk vindt en al gewend bent te werken met Agile Scrum en OutSystems. Jij kan de door jouw opgedane kennis en ervaring als ontwikkelaar binnen onze teams delen en inzetten. Omdat jij zelf wil nadenken en niet elke dag hetzelfde wil ontwikkelen. En omdat je ook als Senior Developer nog wil leren en nieuwsgierig bent.</p>
<p>Wij vinden het belangrijk dat onze klanten zich kunnen focussen op hun core business: ondernemen. Geen gedoe met systemen, lange wachttijden aan de telefoon en niet elke dag een opdringerige energieverkoper aan de deur. Onze klanten zijn op zoek naar een echte energiepartner en willen goedwerkende energieproducten- en systemen. Daar hebben we jou voor nodig! Jij zorgt er samen met het team voor dat er wordt voorzien in de behoeftes van onze (interne) klanten.</p>
<h2>Functievereisten</h2>
<ul>
<li>Je hebt een IT-achtergrond en affiniteit met low-code software development;</li>
<li>Je hebt minimaal vijf jaar ontwikkelervaring opgedaan binnen een professionele IT-setting, waarvan je minimaal drie jaar met OutSystems hebt gewerkt;</li>
<li>Daarnaast heb je kennis van HTML en CSS en weet je hoe het is om te werken met SQL Server (of soortgelijke database);</li>
<li>Het werken met Agile Scrum is jou op je lijf geschreven, hier heb je al ervaring mee;</li>
<li>Communicatief ben je ook sterk, want je werkt veel samen met collega-ontwikkelaars en andere collega’s binnen MAIN.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arbeidsvoorwaarden</h2>
<p>MAIN Energie biedt een uitdagende en afwisselende functie als Senior Software Developer OutSystems binnen een ambitieuze en groeiende organisatie met korte lijnen en een informele werksfeer. Normaal gesproken wordt elke sprint afgesloten met een lunch met het hele team om weer een succesvolle oplevering te vieren. Als gevolg van de Coronamaatregelen is dit even niet mogelijk, maar we organiseren nu leuke extra online activiteiten zoals online quizzen bijvoorbeeld.</p>
<p>Als Senior Software Developer OutSystems ontvang je bij MAIN Energie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Een maandelijks salaris gebaseerd op jouw kennis en ervaring;</li>
<li>Een jaarcontract bij indiensttreding, met een contract voor onbepaalde tijd in het vooruitzicht als de samenwerking van beide kanten goed bevalt;</li>
<li>24 vakantiedagen per jaar, flexibel in te delen werktijden en een premievrij pensioen;</li>
<li>Leer- en ontwikkelmogelijkheden door het volgen van cursussen en/of trainingen;</li>
<li>Een mogelijke individuele- en prestatieafhankelijke bedrijfsbonus aan het eind van het jaar;</li>
<li>Je collega’s hebben ook veel kennis, dus je hebt alle kansen om samen verder te groeien en ontwikkelen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ons kantoor is gevestigd in Diemen en wij zijn uitstekend te bereiken vanuit bijvoorbeeld Amsterdam, Hoofddorp, Almere, Utrecht of Amstelveen. Ook met het ov en de fiets zijn wij goed bereikbaar. We hebben een bushalte voor de deur en een eigen fietsenstalling achter het kantoor.</p>
<p>Ook nu we bijna allemaal vanuit huis werken is het mogelijk om te solliciteren op deze vacature. De kennismaking zal online plaatsvinden via videobellen en vervolgens gaat Roel, IT Manager bij MAIN Energie, ook graag verder met je de diepte in tijdens het tweede gesprek.</p>
<h2>Solliciteren op de vacature van Senior Software Developer OutSystems bij MAIN Energie?</h2>
<p>Ben jij de Senior Developer waar wij naar op zoek zijn? Weet jij als geen ander hoe je nieuwe en bestaande applicaties kan ontwikkelen en onderhouden? Solliciteer direct via het <strong>sollicitatieformulier</strong> en dan reageert Björn Bogerd, onze Corporate Recruiter, zo snel mogelijk op jouw interesse in het werken bij MAIN. Binnen een week nadat je gesolliciteerd hebt mag je van hem een reactie verwachten.</p>
<p><em>Een werk-gerelateerde persoonlijkheidsvragenlijst en een praktijkopdracht kunnen deel uitmaken van de sollicitatieprocedure.</em></p>
<p>Indien je nog vragen hebt dan staat Björn je graag te woord. Hij is bereikbaar via 06-34941387. Je kunt ook mailen met onze recruitmentafdeling via <a href=""mailto:recruitment@mainenergie.nl"">recruitment@mainenergie.nl</a>.</p>

6efab349-9691-4a34-a6e6-96a7b544e60f,false,SENIOR BACKEND DEVELOPER,Clarity Movement Co.,Remote,Mon Oct 26 23:25:39 UTC 2020,https://jobs.github.com/positions/6efab349-9691-4a34-a6e6-96a7b544e60f,Full Time,"<p><strong>Position Overview:</strong></p>
<p>Clarity, a Series A clean-tech startup, is looking for an experienced backend software engineer to join our software team in our mission of bringing clear air to the world. He or she will drive the technical evolution of our IoT sensor data pipeline and support our customer-facing web applications and data analysis tools. Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Oakland, CA.</p>
<p><strong>Our Company:</strong></p>
<p>At Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.</p>
<p>Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.</p>
<p>We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action. Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.</p>
<p>After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors here and here), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p><strong>Our Team:</strong></p>
<p>We are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges. We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create. Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team. How else could you tackle a problem as complex and global as air pollution?</p>
<p><strong>Job Description:</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking a highly self-motivated and passionate backend developer with a proven track record in delivering top-quality code and architectural solutions to bring our Clarity Cloud to the next level. Your key responsibilities will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leading development and maintenance of key system features, including APIs, workers, and databases.
-Interfacing with product management to brainstorm technical solutions to business requirements and evaluate technical feasibility of innovative product features.</li>
<li>Working with other team members to investigate architecture best practices, design approaches and prototype new technology.</li>
<li>Collaborating in an Agile environment to deliver high quality software against well established schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our product is multidisciplinary, ranging from ubiquitous IoT hardware to scalable data pipelines, advanced data quality assurance algorithms and insightful data analyses. You will enjoy freedom of action around these topics and be encouraged to take initiative for making our software offerings truly revolutionary in the clean-tech space. You will have plenty of opportunity to work closely with our customers and end-users who hail from industry, government, NGOs, community groups, and academia. You will be working closely with our CTO to help guide Clarity to success. We believe Clarity could be the right place for you to join the fight to solve environmental issues around the world by leveraging your software superpowers!</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or similar technical field.</li>
<li>3+ years of non-internship professional software development experience.</li>
<li>2+ years of experience contributing to the architecture and design of new and current systems at scale.</li>
<li>2+ years experience building successful production software systems.</li>
<li>Solid understanding and high proficiency in Python, Node.js, MongoDB, REST, GraphQL, and OOD patterns.</li>
<li>Experience with AWS Cloud, especially EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, ECS, S3, SNS, SQS, SES, Cognito and DynamoDB.</li>
<li>Experience with full-stack development frameworks, such as Amplify, Django, etc.</li>
<li>Experience with DevOps on software systems at large scale.</li>
<li>Experience applying Computer Science fundamentals in object-oriented design, data structures and algorithms design, problem solving, and complexity analysis.</li>
<li>Experience defining system architectures and exploring technical feasibility tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Experience working in an Agile environment.</li>
<li>Experience in mentoring team members and defining and championing best practices across a software team.</li>
<li>Experience in communicating with users, other technical teams, and senior management to collect requirements, describe software product features, technical designs, and product strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>

<li>Please submit your application according to the procedures highlighted below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Full Stack Developer - Full-Time: Laravel, Vue.Js - Remote</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>BeMo has an immediate need for a top caliber Full Stack Developer with expertise in Laravel and Vue.js to help our team in ongoing web development, web application, and web maintenance projects</p>
<p><strong>Are you the needle in a haystack?</strong></p>
<p>Would you like to make sure no one is treated unfairly due to his or her cultural, racial, economical or social status? Would you like to help us create the next generation of educational training and university admissions screening softwares?</p>
<p><strong>Here’s a little bit about us:</strong></p>
<p>We believe everyone deserves access to higher education regardless of his or her cultural, racial, economical or social status.</p>
<p>You've probably never worked with anyone like us before. We're a dynamic team of practicing professionals, researchers, and scholars, with a passion to help students reach their academic and career goals. We often go above and beyond to deliver the best possible services we can for our students. We take our own medicine and we are constantly training to keep our individual performance and the performance of our company exceptional.</p>
<p>In addition, we are also creating the next generation of university admissions screening software to reduce the social, racial and economic bias while being able to select better-suited applicants AND save time and money for universities and employers.</p>
<p>We take our role very seriously and contribute to our company on a regular basis whether we work part-time or full-time because we understand the long-term impact of our work. We know how to manage our time and competing demands. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services and impact and we are not afraid to share our ideas and collaborate with our team members.</p>
<p>We put our company and our missions first before our own personal needs and desires. This is not a ""job"" to us. This is a calling. Our passion for mentoring our students and making admissions fair and scientifically sound is what gets us up in the morning. Importantly, we understand that our company is only as great as its individual members. That's how we have become a leading academic consulting firm and that's why we are extremely selective about our team and only pick the very best to join us and we do everything we can to support them.</p>
<p>If you are resistant to learn more and continuous coaching because you believe you already know everything about programming, if you are seeking a side job just to make a few bucks, or to add another entry to your resume, if you normally don't pay much attention to detail and your code is always returned by end users full of bugs, or if you are looking for a short-term gig with little impact and growth, then we're probably not right for you.</p>
<p><strong>But if this is you, you need to apply now.</strong></p>
<p>If you are a fantastic developer with great attention to detail, yet extremely humble, willing to learn more and are not afraid to explore topics that are not your expertise, love to be a part of the team to change the future of higher education and admissions screening, and looking for a long-term mission with significant impact on society, then you need to apply.

<li>Be part of a revolution. We are creating the next generation of candidate selection tools that are light years ahead at selecting best-suited candidates compared to traditional tools, while being fair to applicants.</li>
<li>Be part of a team of A-players. We only hire the brightest individuals with the highest caliber, character and courage.</li>
<li>Freedom to choose your hours. We don't believe in 9-5. We believe in accomplishments of the highest standard.</li>

<li>You never have to go to the ""office"";</li>
<li>24/7 support. We don't sleep. If you need our help, we'll be there for you because this means more than just a “job” to us.</li>

a041aeae-68c9-40e5-b39d-0e74f206acfb,false,Full-Stack Software Developer,Growth Tools,Remote,Fri Oct 23 15:57:45 UTC 2020,https://jobs.github.com/positions/a041aeae-68c9-40e5-b39d-0e74f206acfb,Full Time,"<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We’re hiring a software engineer because we need your expertise and experience
to help us accomplish <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/3d654bf2be1d48be92ca6ee8ccbb65ba"">our mission</a>
as a company. That mission is to help our clients grow their company so they
can focus on solving big problems in the world.</p>
<p>See, we believe that humans are built to make things. And one of the best ways
to get more people making more things, is to help them sell their products and
services they invent.</p>
<p>We know how to do that over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>That’s why our mission is helping our clients grow their revenue by <em>$100
million per year</em>. It’s a measure of the impact we’re having and how effective
we are as a company.</strong></p>
<p>And that is where you come in!</p>
<p>We’ve maxed out what our small Engineering team (myself and 2 part-time
contractors) can do. We need your help to level our team up. You will not just
be slotted in somewhere. You are our second full time developer hire. You will
help me set the culture and direction of our team from here on out. I need
someone to work collaboratively with so both of us can do better work than
we’ve ever done before.</p>
<p><strong>We’re a different kind of software development team.</strong></p>
<p>First, you’ll ship. Our #1 KPI’s involve shipping. No endless rounds of review.
No abandoned projects 80% of the way through. What you build will be used by
real people. How?</p>
<p>No made up features. We think from <a href=""https://twitter.com/Harris_Bryan/status/1296782480746438656"">first principles</a>
and solve problems. We don’t invent random stuff and don’t have “pet features”.
No one comes down from on high with “the next great idea” that no one actually
wants to use (or build).</p>
<p>Everything you build will solve a real problem for ourselves and/or our users.</p>
<p>Next, we are anti-code monkeys.</p>
<p>We know it’s imperative that you understand how and why people use what we
build. You aren’t handed a spec and sent off to build. You’ll be involved early
on when shaping a project and uncovering the real problem we’re trying to
solve. Then, we work forward as a team to invent the best possible way on Earth
to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Lastly, we avoid red tape and bureaucracy. Think a new design pattern will be
really effective? Discovered a new library that can help us move faster? Want
to adopt a new process or best practice? Let’s do it! You’ll help us constantly
improve through quick experiments and no dogma.</p>
<p>What this means day-to-day:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend 80-90% of your time developing software. Solving product problems. Writing code. Reviewing PRs. Hands dirty. Shipping.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication by default. Have a record of what we want to do and why. Give ourselves the space to work deeply.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this means in the medium/long term:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work directly with me, Director of Engineering, to continue shaping our engineering team. Make what’s working better and fix what not (or has stopped) working in our culture and processes.</li>
<li>Potential to grow into a leader as we expand the team further (expecting 6 more full time engineers in the next 18 months).</li>
<li>Truly, doing your best work by mainly getting out of your way, removing roadblock, and letting you be awesome!</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, your core areas of focus for this role will be:</p>
<p>Software development: code, style, build. Problem solving: product development,
identify and solve real-world problems. Project management: organize your work
and help organize the team. Create Stories/To Do items for yourself and others
as needs arise.</p>
<h2>What will you learn in this role?</h2>
<p>If you come from a large enterprise experience, you may be accustomed to long
roadmaps and even longer meetings. You may be used to waiting for weeks to
months to get approval to try something new. You may feel like a small cog in a
very large machine. We’re pretty much the opposite. You will learn to work
quickly on small timelines. Instead of “We’ll add that to the end of our 3 year
roadmap.” We think “How can we solve this in the next few weeks?” and “Can we
simplify and ship quicker?”</p>
<p>If you come from a more of a startup background, you’ll feel right more at
home. You will wear many hats and sometimes be called to help in areas that may
not be explicitly in your core areas. You will also learn that adding a little
discipline and structure to processes can actually increase productivity and
enable more alignment.</p>
<p>In this role you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to avoid the knee-jerk “Ok, I can build that” response and instead dig a little deeper to get to the true root problem to be solved.</li>
<li>How to collaborate on software that the entire team owns. We all are responsible for everything.</li>
<li>How just the right amount of upfront planning creates a controlled, yet fast, environment where we can ship more rapidly than others expect.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who will you work with?</h2>
<p>You will work directly with me, Chris Marshall, the Director of Engineering.
You will be the second full time engineer on the team (after me). We also have
a part-time designer and front-end engineer. They will be on our weekly calls
and you’ll work closely with each of them.</p>
<p>For the first 3 to 6 months, we will be the only two full-time folks on the
team. During 2021, our plan is to continue to build the team to 8 full-time
engineers by the end of Q1 2022. During that time we’ll split into 2 or more
min-teams and you’ll be given the opportunity to lead one of those should you
choose.</p>
<p>You’ll also interact with all of our other core team members on a regular basis
during weekly company calls and when we build internal tools for others within
the company.</p>
<h2>Where will you work?</h2>
<p>We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to
Cleveland, and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to
work from home or a coworking location, or to take the family to Peru for the
summer and work from your terrace overlooking the Andes Mountains.</p>
<p>We don’t micromanage you. Rather, we expect you to be responsible for yourself.
Show up for meetings on-time and communicate proactively. Working hours are
generally flexible and the work you do is more important than the number of
hours you work (in fact we actively discourage long hours and working on the
weekends).</p>
<h2>What does Growth Tools do and why?</h2>
<p>Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses double
their revenue in 1 year. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give
away for free. Our training programs consist of a 1:1 coaching business, Growth
University,</p>
<p>We believe that the world is a better place when people create and those
creations are shared.</p>
<p>Example: I looooove Allbird shoes.</p>
<p>Guess how Allbirds came to exist? A dude, Tim Brown, had the idea for them. And
he had enough gumption and know-how to go out and actually make them. Now
Allbirds is one of the most successful upstart shoe brands from the past 5
years.</p>
<p>The world is a better place when every Tim out there turns their ideas into
real-life products.</p>
<p>That’s why our goal is to generate $100 million in revenue for our clients.
That is our measurement that these creations are being shared and real value is
being generated as a result.</p>
<p>Do you want to be on the front lines and directly involved with growing some of
the coolest and most innovative companies in the world and shaping one of the
best engineering teams in the world?</p>
<p>If you are interested in solving challenging problems with software and
building amazing and innovative products with me, I can’t wait to talk to
you!</p>

<p>We are Ascent. We’re on a mission to help our customers connect data, software and purpose to create extraordinary outcomes. You could say we are a digital transformation business. But we’d rather say we help people solve problems, or do new things, or do existing things better.</p>
<p>We specialise in software product development, analytics and data science, IoT solutions, machine learning, DevOps optimisation and modernisation of applications, data and platforms. And in case you were wondering, our customers are awesome. From smart home devices, space exploration and beer to manufacturing, finance, ecology and logistics - we work with some of the sharpest minds in the brightest businesses.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p>
<p>Required skills and qualifications:</p>
<p>Minimum 5 years C# backend development experience.
Experience with RESTful APIs

It seeks to disrupt the publisher-driven model of paid-for “professionally” made educational content, by putting high-quality content creation in the hands of teachers and making that teacher-made content, freely accessible through our online community.</p>

To apply, send a CV to <a href=""mailto:techtalent@flown.com"">techtalent@flown.com</a>.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE ROLE</h3>
<p>FLOWN is an early-stage tech startup and this role offers the opportunity to start right at the beginning of building a new tech stack. You'll be contributing to the design and development of the product, and steering the direction we take in the future.</p>
<p>We are developing tools, and providing access to spaces, that help our customers get into states of deep work and think more creatively and productively. Over the next few months we'll be building: our marketing website, a property catalogue, a booking engine and payments solution, a content portal along with games and tools to support our members in embracing deep work principles.</p>
<p>We then have ambitious plans for the future once we're finished with those!</p>
<h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
<p>Above all, we're looking for someone with the experience and confidence to take charge of projects and deliver them with minimal oversight.</p>
<p>When you're given a project you'll need to figure out the requirements by asking the right questions of the ops and product teams, list the possible technical designs, discuss the pros and cons of each with other developers, build a finished product, and own it in production.</p>
<p>In terms of technical experience, you must have built multiple applications as the sole or lead developer, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You must also either have experience with React and TypeScript, or with multiple other UI frameworks and typed languages.</p>
<p>Bonus points for experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data model design for NoSQL databases.</li>
<li>Serverless architecture (especially function-as-a-service and event-driven architectures).</li>
<li>Responsibility for deployments, monitoring and backups of production services.</li>
<li>API design.</li>
<li>Working on personal projects or open source contributions - we love to see developers' side projects - even if they're not related to what we're building.</li>
</ul>
<h3>BENEFITS</h3>
<p>We want to practice what we preach, and build a company and team that works creatively and productively. Here are some of the benefits you'll gain from this role:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope and influence - you're joining the founding team, where our developers are integrated into the business. You'll participate in the early analysis and design process, understand the business problems we're trying to solve, and get the chance to propose ingenious designs that minimise the amount of work we have to do.</li>
<li>A focus on deep work - we exist to support deep work among our members, so we support our staff in developing their own distraction-free deep work practice.</li>
<li>A strong team - you'll work closely with a proven CEO &amp; Founder, and a highly experienced team. We have a high-calibre of investors with a good amount of runway.</li>
<li>Work/life balance - our standard full-time week is 32 hours, and (within reason) you can decide how to structure those hours across the week.</li>
<li>Fully dispersed - we are a remote-first company, and we've got lots of perks, tools and processes to make sure that works for everyone. We also allocate budgets to ensure that you can work comfortably and/or get together with other team members when you need to.</li>
<li>Team offsites and regular fun - we get together each quarter (ideally somewhere sunny) to collaborate and have fun. We also embed virtual activities and other surprises into our working days.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ABOUT FLOWN</h3>
<p>Even before COVID, working in open-plan offices full of distractions was not the best environment for producing our best work. Studies show that our best productivity and creativity comes when you get a chance to do 'deep work' - uninterrupted focused time working on something significant. Post-COVID, the need for places to work ergonomically away from your office - either as an individual or as a team - is even greater. FLOWN is the first global brand seeking to provide the ideal physical and mental spaces for us to think and work more creatively and productively.</p>
<p>FLOWN will offer a marketplace of spaces suitable for individuals or teams to get away from their day-to-day to concentrate, contemplate or collaborate. We'll offer not only physical spaces - think Airbnb for Work - but mental spaces through our app and online services. Available to individuals and companies as a subscription, to be offered as an accompaniment or replacement to traditional office rental.</p>
<p>FLOWN is led by successful serial entrepreneur, Alicia Navarro, founder of Skimlinks (acquired by Connexity April 2020), and backed well-known entrepreneurs and angels such as Greg Marsh (OneFineStay), Taavet Hinrikus (Transferwise), Tom Allason (Shutl). FLOWN is seeking to create social impact by democratisating access to the kind of spaces that can best unleash our human potential, so we can not only solve real global problems but also live more meaningful lives.</p>

<p>You’d be part of a team developing a state of the art scalable platform as a service solution for 30+ marketplaces, using Kubernetes, Docker and Microservices. Each marketplace brings its own infrastructure and a unique set of challenges, so no two days are ever the same.</p>
<p>As well as automating the operations and production of large-scale distributed systems, you’d support features like blue-green deployments, automated canary releasing and automated promotion to production.</p>
<p><strong>Your objective:</strong></p>
<p>Support hundreds of instances and multi-tenant Kubernentes clusters for millions of consumers, and build self-service solutions for 1000+ developers!</p>
<h2><strong>Working at Adevinta</strong></h2>
<p>You’d be based in Barcelona, but would work closely with cross-functional, multicultural tech teams in Paris and around the world.</p>
<p>Each team chooses their own tech stack and big data/cloud tools, and as teams are small everyone is involved in decision making. Because Adevinta is a new company - and we’re growing - there’s also a chance to influence the organisation’s engineering direction and decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies and methodologies</strong></p>
<p>Kubernetes, Golang, Docker, Microservices, Agile, CI/CD</p>

<p>You work on a banking product being used by seven million customers at Rabobank, one of the largest IT employers in the Netherlands. As an area architect, you will be helping to build microservices and web applications that make digital banking possible worldwide.</p>
<h2>Create an impact</h2>
<p>Within the Distribution department you will work together with more than 50 DevOps teams to develop and manage the online channels of Rabobank. Examples of our success are the Rabobank Banking App, the rabobank.nl and rabobank.com websites, corporate banking, onboarding for online secure clients and digital identification.</p>
<p>Rabobank’s digital platform is based on modern web technology. Rabobank’s mobile platform incorporates this web-based platform and extends it by providing native apps for iOS and Android with additional security measures, and by integrating tightly with the mobile platforms the apps run on.</p>
<p>Within the tribe Digital Platform, we are organized in areas. Each area has a number of squads that work on a common purpose, like the public sites, the app and site for consumers &amp; freelancers, and secure authentication of users.</p>
<p>As an area architect, you will contribute to the digital transformation of the bank within such an area and will be the driving force behind developments, such as Open Banking. All development is done within the cloud using the latest cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>In the area Authorization we provide authorization services on our user, customer and product administration to all other IT departments in the bank. For business users we provide the means to configure their own authorization schemes for their organization. We are planning to migrate our current architecture to a completely new, modern, state of the art authorization architecture. You can be a part in designing and realizing this architecture! You will be leading and coaching the architecture team!</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we expect that you have at least five years of experience with customer-facing web applications in enterprise environments. You know how to build systems that are easy to operate and maintain and that can last a long time while undergoing changes continuously. You are a communicative team player, and have a drive to improve yourself and the people around you. You are a sparring partner for both business and IT and are able to express yourself clearly depending on your audience.</p>
<h2>With each other</h2>
<p>Working together as a team within Distribution is a highly important part within your working day. As an architect you will be working closely with multiple international DevOps teams. You guide the teams towards the best results in a future-proof architecture.</p>
<p>Within Distribution everyone keeps each other on their toes and helps each other where possible. We expect the same from you. This also applies to experimenting in the use of the latest techniques and technologies.</p>
<p>You need to have the courage to challenge and develop yourself even when you and your team make a mistake. The important part is that you (and your team) learn from that and grow.</p>
<h2>With your talents</h2>
<p>For this position it is logical that you need to understand our growing customer needs. You can achieve this by having an unstoppable hunger and drive to work with the latest techniques and cutting-edge technologies. In addition, it’s important that you will recognize yourself in the following checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have at minimum a completed (technical) bachelor degree</li>
<li>You have extensive experience with working in large organizations on complex technological landscapes</li>
<li>You have demonstrable knowledge of authorization systems and relevant architectures</li>
<li>You have experience with the full lifecycle of software, from idea to retirement, using modern techniques like microservices and fully automated pipelines.</li>
<li>You have experience with modern web technologies (Angular, Ionic), back-end technologies (microservices, Java) and cloud (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure)</li>
<li>You are familiar with the rituals of Agile / Scrum</li>
<li>You have an opinion and an open view on the future</li>
<li>You embrace changes and self-leadership is in your DNA!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let’s meet.</h2>
<p>Are you the person we’re looking for?</p>
<p>Are you our new colleague who will strengthen Rabobank as an area architect for our digital platform and thus make the difference for yourself, our customers and society?</p>
<p>If you are, we are happy to receive your application including your motivation via <a href=""https://vonq.io/2T7KQLd"">this link!</a></p>

<li>Lois Hageman, senior recruiter, would be happy to answer any questions about the application procedure via <a href=""mailto:marie-louise.hageman@rabobank.nl"">marie-louise.hageman@rabobank.nl</a>

<li>The application process includes screening. Based on the screening procedures in place at Rabobank, we assess whether new staff are reliable enough to work at Rabobank.</li>
<li>Everyone is different, and it is exactly those differences that help us become an even better bank. That's why we want to know who you really are!</li>

63b9601e-b634-4464-ac69-8ef2f1f1c896,false,Senior Engineer,Volition,San Francisco Bay Area,Thu Oct 22 00:53:53 UTC 2020,https://jobs.github.com/positions/63b9601e-b634-4464-ac69-8ef2f1f1c896,Full Time,"<p>Our Mission: Our mission is to accelerate hardware creation by making tools that increase the speed and performance of engineering and manufacturing processes for mechanical engineers, roboticists, product designers, and beyond.</p>
<p>Our Company: We are a newly funded (Dec 2019), seed stage, pre-product-market fit company, and though we’re very early, we bring with us the experience and customers from building previous companies in this exact space. We’re led by seasoned entrepreneurs, bringing 100s of personal big client relationships in our industry with us, and have many years of runway ahead of us with money in the bank from some of the top VCs and angels in Silicon Valley. Many of our team members previously worked together at a startup, which has proven helpful in creating a trusted core team from the start. We’ve also conducted thorough customer research interviews, as well as industry / vendor research, etc. to confirm our hypotheses and strategy have a high probability of success.</p>
<p>We’re currently in stealth mode, so we’re not talking about our product or strategy publicly, so please reach out to us, and we’ll tell you all about it. Here is a public video and talk deck that will give you a taste of our broad vision for remaking how humanity designs and manufactures physical products. We know this is a teaser, but trust us, it’s worth it :-)</p>
<p>About the Role: We’re looking for a Senior Engineer to join our engineering team. You will report to the CTO and will push our development initiatives forward to build our MVP product and iterate to product-market fit by QE2 2021. To do so, you’ll work alongside the founding team to create the strategy and plan, and you’ll help mentor a team of engineers and outsourced development teams - helping build both our customer UX and core scalable data processing technology. This position offers potential opportunities to expand into leadership as the company grows.</p>
<p>Tech Stack: We use modern technologies to leapfrog others in our industry burdened by legacy stacks. We embrace the cloud, including containers and event-driven serverless architecture where it makes sense. Our web apps are built with node, typescript, vue, nuxt, and connect to backend systems that use GraphQL, Postgres, and Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Our Founders: Volition was founded by Nick Pinkston (CEO) and Jeremy Herrman (CTO) who are veteran startup founders who previously co-founded Plethora together in 2013 where they built a new kind of highly flexible automated factory to speed up the prototyping and production process for some of the top hardware companies and products in the world. They grew the business to 80+ employees and millions in annual revenue before they left to start Volition, an even more ambitious and scalable project.</p>
<p>Our Team and Culture: We’re currently a small team of seven working remotely and plan to resume working together in our office in San Francisco once all is safe. We’re committed to building a strong culture that values developing the whole person: mind, body, and spirit, and we are in the process of integrating professional and personal development systems into our core company cadences. We’re committed to continually improving our hiring processes and policies to deliberately build the best team by drawing from many diverse backgrounds and perspectives.</p>
<p>Our Compensation: We offer competitive salaries, significant stock options, good healthcare, and other benefits in-line with companies of similar size.</p>
<p>Our Risk Management: The world is crazy now with Covid-19, and we hope you, family, and friends are staying healthy. We want you to know that we’re well prepared for any crisis as we have raised enough capital to have several years of runway including new hires and other needs of our plan. Our target market is also highly stable, so we don’t anticipate much go-to-market risk even in the case of a prolonged recession.</p>
<p>We are committed to being an Equal Opportunity Employer.</p>

<h2><strong>Stel je eens voor…</strong></h2>
<p>die glimlach op het gezicht van onze klant die via de smartphone inzicht krijgt in zijn woonsituatie. Hier kan jij voor zorgen.</p>

<li>Werk in multidisciplinaire Scrumteams en ga samen voor het beste resultaat</li>

<p>Samenwerken in een informele sfeer is de manier waarop wij werken. Tribe Wonen, bundelt de krachten in multidisciplinaire teams om de beste en meest innovatieve producten neer te zetten.</p>
<p>Denk hierbij aan het Rabobank Hypotheekoverzicht in de Rabo-app. Dit doen wij door gefocust te blijven en altijd kilometers vóór de feiten uit te lopen. Samen in één team met niet alleen collega’s van IT, maar ook samen met collega’s van andere afdelingen zoals o.a. productmanagement, Operations en Marketing. Samen moeten we het doen, jij kan de ander beter maken.</p>
<p>Door bijvoorbeeld brainbits te organiseren waar we elkaar wekelijks bijpraten over (nieuwe) tooling / technieken, guilds te organiseren op specifieke vakgebieden maar ook door ‘gewoon’ samen achter 1 bureau te ontwikkelen / reviewen leren we constant en houden we elkaar scherp.</p>
<p>Ruimte voor POC’s pak je met beide handen aan waardoor je honger naar innovatie kan worden gestild.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jaarlijks investeren we flink in het Nederlandse verenigingsleven. We ondersteunen zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn.</li>
<li>We financieren de onderwijssector in Nederland met 500 miljoen euro per jaar. Want goed onderwijs is het fundament voor de maatschappij van de toekomst.</li>
<li>Rabobank is al sinds 2007 klimaatneutraal. We zetten ons elke dag in om een duurzamere leefomgeving te creëren. We stimuleren collega’s met het openbaar vervoer naar kantoor te komen en gebruiken groene energie.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Wil jij dit ook?</strong></h2>
<p>De beste versie van jezelf worden? Wij helpen je er graag bij door jouw ontwikkeling centraal te stellen en te investeren in een omgeving waarin je blijft leren.

My name is Krystyn Harrison, President at OrderMetrics. We’re looking to build the OrderMetrics team to help us in our mission to make it feel effortless for every digital merchant to grow their business.</p>
<p>Thousands of online shops around the world already use OrderMetrics to get an up-to-the-moment snapshot of their profit analytics and marketing performance. We’re honored to say many of our customers are obsessed with OrderMetrics—some even have our dashboard on a designated display in their office, so they can always keep an eye on their bottom line!</p>
<p>We’ve been around since 2016, but we’ve got big growth goals over the next few years. In service of that, we’re launching a whole new OrderMetrics in Q4 of 2020. It’s a complete refresh. A rebrand. A rebirth. A clean slate. We’ve got great bones, a clear value being delivered to our customers, and we’re rebuilding the guts of this business from the ground up, to help us grow even faster.</p>
<p>OrderMetrics is a completely remote team, led by a stellar leadership team including VP of Customer Engagement Jordan Matheson and VP of Marketing Ryan Kopperud, and myself. In 2019, we were acquired by Assembly, which puts us in a uniquely funded position, and in the good company of a family of strong e-commerce software businesses.</p>
<p>We are looking to hire a Principal Software Engineer to manage and oversee the engineering team at OrderMetrics. This individual will report directly to the CTO and indirectly to the President at OrderMetrics.</p>

Break down work and spot issues early and your collaboration should make the entire organization faster, better, stronger.
Take initiative working with other teams and functions to drive important changes through for our users and our colleagues, and spot places where we can work smarter without having to be asked.
Prioritize well and help others on the team sort through what work is the most important, and help them stay focused.
You will work alongside a Product Manager to prioritize and build new features at OM and lead a small engineering team focused on customer support issues and new growth features in 2021</p>

<p><strong>Bonus if you have:</strong></p>
<p>AWS knowledge
Experience with Elastic EMR (Amazon tool for Hadoop)
Domain expertise - in business intelligence saas or fintech (e.g., Wave Accounting, Freshbooks, etc.) and ideally in e-commerce</p>
<p><strong>Compensation</strong> Our salary band is $150k to $200k CAD annually. We are flexible, so please apply if you think you’re the right person!</p>

<p><strong>Daarom wil je als senior iOS developer bij NS werken</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Je werkt mee aan de NS-app met meer dan 2 miljoen maandelijkse gebruikers!</li>
<li>Je komt in een multidisciplinair team terecht en krijgt vrijheid om te experimenteren met nieuwe Apple technologie.</li>
<li>De NS-app en backend API’s “runnen en hosten"" we als team zelf.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Martijn: “Het is super tof om software te schrijven waar zoveel mensen gebruik van maken en te werken met nieuwe technologieën.""</em></p>
<p><strong>Dit ga je doen als senior iOS developer</strong>
NS barst van de IT! De NS app wordt maandelijks door zo’n 2 miljoen mensen gebruikt. Dat is meteen ook de reden waarom onze developers onmisbaar zijn. We innoveren op veel fronten en kunnen jouw kennis en expertise goed gebruiken om de iOS NS apps en backend API’s verder te bouwen en te beheren. Goed om te weten is dat we de app zelf “runnen en hosten”. We bouwen en beheren dus niet alleen de voorkant maar ook de achterkant. Dit betekent dat je snel nieuwe functionaliteiten kunt maken, uitproberen en in productie moet houden, oftewel; “You build it, you run it!”. Je krijgt alle vrijheid om te experimenteren met Apple-technologie. De backend is geschreven in Java en Kotlin en gehost op Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><strong>Hier ga jij werken</strong>

<li>Qua tools gebruik je: Xcode, IntelliJ, Zeplin</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>En verder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is het een pre als je een eigen iOS app hebt gepubliceerd en/of ervaring hebt met overige AWS services.</li>
<li>Is het een pre als je ervaring hebt met REST-API ontwerp en implementatie in Java en/of Kotlin.</li>
<li>Je bent leergierig en nieuwsgierig, je kijkt al naar nieuwe methodes en technieken zoals Reactive programming, Protocol oriented programming en SwiftUI. Je leest graag technische blogs en/of gaat regelmatig naar conferenties en meetups</li>
<li>Het team bestaat grotendeels uit technische mensen die elkaars werk kunnen overnemen. Dit betekent dat je continu kennis en kunde deelt. Of het nou gaat om nieuwe technieken, tooling of een oplossing die je gebouwd hebt.</li>

Als front-end developer ontwikkel je applicaties voor wonen, betalen en bankieren met een Angular-framework. En dat voor honderdduizenden gebruikers! Check de vacature.</strong></p>
<p>Is mijn salaris al gestort? Had ik het geld al overgemaakt? Mensen checken hun bankapplicaties steeds vaker. Soms zelfs tientallen keren per dag! Dankzij jouw werk als frontend-developer verloopt dat allemaal gesmeerd. Jij zorgt ervoor dat Volksbank-applicaties voor bijvoorbeeld internetbankieren en wonen er strak uitzien en dat klanten er probleemloos in kunnen navigeren.</p>
<p>Samen met je collega’s bouw, test, beheer en documenteer je applicaties. Dit doe je met behulp van een breed scala aan frontend-ontwikkeltechnieken en onze eigen componentenbibliotheek op basis van Angular. Je werkt aan interessante projecten. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de online Huismap, waarmee klanten en hypotheekadviseurs snel en simpel informatie en documenten met elkaar kunnen uitwisselen. Of aan Payconiq: een systeem waarmee je met je smartphone in winkels, online en aan vrienden kunt betalen.</p>
<p>Als frontend-developer heb jij veel oog voor de klantbeleving van onze applicaties. Waar hebben gebruikers behoefte aan? Wat werkt goed – en wat juist niet? Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met vertegenwoordigers en productowners van de business en ben je regelmatig op ons hoofdkantoor in Utrecht. Met je collega’s werk je aan software die onze financiële dienstverlening aan klanten versnelt, vereenvoudigt en verbetert. Jouw vernieuwende ideeën zijn hierbij natuurlijk meer dan welkom!</p>
<h2>Hier kom je te werken</h2>
<p>Jij gaat werken bij een van de scrumteams van de value-organisatie. Jouw team ontwikkelt applicaties die nodig zijn om veranderingen in de business te realiseren en implementeren op het gebied van betalen, wonen, finance en risk, en klantrelaties. Ook zelf zijn we volop in ontwikkeling. Zo beland je midden in de transitie naar DevOps-teams en krijg je de kans om mee te denken over verbetering en verandering. Hoewel je standplaats Den Bosch is, kan het zijn dat je ook regelmatig thuis of op onze locatie in Utrecht werkt.</p>
<h2>Jouw kwaliteiten</h2>
<p>Een nieuwsgierige, inhoud gedreven professional met een flinke dosis lef en een aanstekelijk enthousiasme. Dat ben jij in een notendop. Daarnaast beschik je over een kritische blik, het vermogen om complexe problemen te analyseren en de vindingrijkheid om eenvoudige creatieve oplossingen te bedenken. Oplossingen waar de klant écht iets aan heeft. Nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen volg je op de voet, bijvoorbeeld doordat je onze lezingen, pizzasessies en hackathons bijwoont. Jouw kennis deel je graag. Iedereen kan bij jou rekenen op een helder verhaal. Want jij kunt je makkelijk inleven in anderen, of dat nou je backend-collega, een hypotheekadviseur uit de business of de klant is.</p>
<p>Verder heb je:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hbo werk- en denkniveau;</li>
<li>Minimaal drie jaar ervaring met frontend-ontwikkeling;</li>
<li>Ervaring met frontend-ontwikkeltechnieken en -frameworks zoals: Angular, Jasmine, Protractor, Cucumber, SASS, BDD, TDD, NgRx, HTML5, JavaScript, TypeScript. stylesheets, CSS, SAS, NodeJS en Grunt of Gulp;</li>
<li>Bij voorkeur ervaring met backend-technologieën, zoals middleware, security, service-oriented architecture, Spring Boot en databases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solliciteren?</h2>
<p>Upload je motivatie en cv via <a href=""https://vonq.io/36TuFsY"">deze link!</a>. We nemen dan zo snel mogelijk contact met je op.
